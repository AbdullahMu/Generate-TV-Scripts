<h1 id="generate-tv-scripts">Generate TV Scripts</h1>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this project, you’ll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You’ll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you’ll build will generate a new, “fake” TV script.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-project-files">Getting the project files</h3>
<p>The project files can be found in our  <a href="https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch">public GitHub repo</a>, in the  <code>project-tv-script-generation</code>  folder. You can download the files from there, but it’s better to clone the repository to your computer using:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
</code></pre>
<p>This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with  <code>git pull</code>.</p>
<p>You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you’ve passed all the unit tests in the notebook.</li>
<li>Ensure you pass all points on  <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2260/view">the rubric</a>.</li>
<li>When you’re done with the project, please save the notebook as both an .ipynb file and as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the  <strong>File</strong>  menu in the notebook and choosing “Download as” &gt; HTML.  <strong>Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it’s HTML version together.</strong></li>
<li>Package the “dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb”, “<a href="http://helper.py">helper.py</a>”, “problem_unittests.py”, and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.</li>
<li>Hit Submit Project to submit your final zip file!</li>
